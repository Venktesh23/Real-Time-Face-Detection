# Real-Time-Face-Detection-with-OpenCV-and-Streamlit

Face detection is a fundamental task in computer vision with numerous applications in security, surveillance, biometrics, and more. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to perform real-time face detection 

using OpenCV and create a simple web application using Streamlit to interactively detect faces either from a live camera feed or an uploaded image.


# Setting Up the Environment

First, ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the necessary libraries by running:

pip install opencv-python-headless streamlit pillow


# Real-Time Face Detection from Webcam

Let's start by implementing real-time face detection from a webcam stream. We'll use OpenCV to capture frames from the webcam and detect faces using the Haar cascade classifier.

# Face Detection from Uploaded Images

Next, let's implement face detection from uploaded images. We'll enhance the Streamlit app to allow users to upload an image file and detect faces within it.


# Conclusion


We've implemented face detection from a live webcam stream and enhanced the application to allow users to upload images for face detection. This simple web application can be further extended and customized for various face detection tasks.
